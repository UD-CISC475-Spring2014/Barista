TODO:
	Check on the mappings for VendAddress/the rest of the foreign keys
	
	Modify the pom.xml so that it will actually get the sqljdbc4.jar in
	dependencies
	Do so for tools.jar as well, though this should be in the JDK/JRE lib
	you have to manually import for God knows what reason
	
	
ASK GIBBONS:
	Shouldn't the column for AddrID in tblProjectEvent be a foreign key mapping
	to tblVendAddress like every other table does?
	
	Where are the passwords? Do users create a new account to do anything?
	
	Andrew: Do we have to create another table for username/password?
	Dan: I think we are using the email as the username. Idk about the passwords.
	
	In the stored procedure for Insert in the Vendor Table,
	We cannot return the UniqueIdentifier correctly, also Andrew is still
	unsure about returning that value
